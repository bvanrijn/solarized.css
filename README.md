# solarized.css

## What's this?
A simple, lightweight CSS framework that uses the *awesome* color scheme designed by Ethan Schoonover. Uses HTML, CSS and Stylus. New features will be added all the time and **solarized.css** cannot be considered stable enough, because it still lacks features and contains only the very basic in styling.

## Features

What are the **solarized.css** features right now?, you might ask. Well, this:

* Basic page markup (font stack, background color, font size)
* Heading sizes (h1 to h6)
* Formatting classes for bold, italic and underlined text
* Buttons
* Hyperlink styling

## Upcoming features

I want to add (and encourage the community to contribute)

* Forms
* Menu
* Bootstrap '.alert'-esque alert messages
* More buttons, maybe?
* Color classes to make make text stand out
* Code blocks
* Quotes
* A Solarized Light version
